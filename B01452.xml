            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Compliance with your Commands, obliging me to give you my Thoughts upon what the Anſwerer of Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s Speech has ſaid in Relation to the Civil and Common Laws, which he has been pleas'd to produce (as he thinks, conducing to his purpoſe) you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this. You very well obſerve that this Anſwer has prevailed with many (eſpecially thoſe whoſe Education has not enabled them to examine his Quotations) to entertain Opinions that we were very hardly, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> with, as to the Affair of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> contrary both to the <hi>Laws of Nations, Civil</hi> and <hi>Old Common Law of England.</hi> All that I have to alledg in the matter, is, that the Civil Law never made Proviſion in ſuch a Caſe as the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be; becauſe unreaſonable, as I ſhall demonſtrate in this following Letter: And as for his Old Common Law, i'll appeal to all the unprejudic'd World, if it reaches the buſineſs he brought it in for. His Laws of Nations I ſhall not concern my ſelf in, both as 'tis not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by you, and likewiſe becauſe 'tis too abſtruſe; but it will be I think, ſufficient for me to prove, he prevaricates with the Laws (I mean Civil and Common) which the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Engliſh World are better acquainted with, and ſo leave you to judge of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Perſon: For 'till he convinces me that it is a Law of Nations for every Prince to prove (when the next preſumed Heir does or does not demand it) That the Child, he is ſatisfied, was Born of his Wife, be truly ſo; though ſuch a thing might happen when ſhe was perhaps at Prayers in her Cloſet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, till he proves this to be uſual amongſt all Nations; For as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> (who I think, underſtood the Law of Nations as well as this Gentleman) defines the Laws of Nations to be, it is, <hi>Quo jure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">Inſtit. lib. 1. Tit. 2. Sect. 1.</note> I believe I may very well forbear any thing of that matter. It will not be unneceſſary, if I hint that the freedom I uſe is cauſed chiefly by the Security a private Letter ought to carry with it, which I ſuppoſe, will ſufficiently admoniſh you of the Caution and Circumſpection you are to uſe in Expoſing it.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, he Aſſerts that <hi>the Civil Law upon any Occaſion of Suſpicion</hi> (obſerve the word of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>ANY OCCASION,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Did Order that Notice be given twice a Week to the Parties
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175411:2"/>concerned; that they may receive full ſatisfaction; that the Mother is to be kept in an Houſe by it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. As in the Anſwer to the Speech; and all this <hi>upon any Occaſion of Suſpicion.</hi> In Anſwer to which, I reply, what the Civil Law mentions in Relation to Spurious Iſſues, or Suppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Births, may be reduced to a very narrow Compaſs, without leaving any thing material unſaid. <hi>The Sanatus Conſultum Plancianum</hi> (of which Digeſt. <hi>Lib.</hi> 25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>de Agnoſcendis &amp; Alendis Liberis</hi>) contains two Caſes; of which the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Commands that a Woman Divorſed from her Husband, ſhall within thirty days after this Divorſe give Notice to her Husband, if ſhe be with Child, that he may take care of, and make proviſion for it; or that the Husband deny the Wife to be ſo with Child by him; which if he does not do, he is obliged to take care of, and Educate the Child that ſhall be Born of her.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>That thoſe Women who after a Divorſe, feign a falſe Birth, render themſelves Obnoxious and Puniſhable;</hi> as the Law in ſuch Caſes has provided: Of which ſee <hi>Cod. Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 22. <hi>Ad Legem Corneliam de falſis.</hi> Which was then Capital, but was afterwards moderated by the Emperor <hi>Leo. Novel.</hi> 77.</p>
            <p>But in the Time of <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Verus</hi> Emperors, there happen'd two New Caſes; and by conſequence, requir'd a new Remedy; the firſt was of a Woman Divorſed from her Husband, who denied ſhe was big with Child by him; the Husband Aſſerted ſhe was: upon which (the Man earneſtly deſiring an Heir to his Family) the Emperors wrote to <hi>Valerius Priſcianus</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi> of the City, <hi>That it ſeem'd moſt fit to them upon the Husband's Requeſt, that three Midwives ſhould be ſent to this Woman and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Of which Digeſt. 25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 4. <hi>de Ventre inſpiciendo.</hi> The other Caſe was, of a Woman, who after the Death of her Husband affirm'd her ſelf with Child; upon which the <hi>Praetor</hi> Commanded, <hi>That, that Woman who, after the Death of her Husband, Aſſerted her ſelf to be with Child, ſhould give Notice twice a Month to them, to whom this matter did appertain,</hi> viz. The next Heirs at Law; that ſatisfaction might be given them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in the Anſwer p. 13. From hence, Sir, I think you may plainly diſcern the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of this Anſwerer. For I appeal to you, and profeſs I would to all Mankind if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Caſes (and yet they are thoſe he refers us to; and I Challenge him to give me any other in Civil Law, any ways relating to ſuppoſititious Births) have any Relation to that of the Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> The firſt of theſe Caſes, being between a Husband and his Wife after a Divorſe: The ſecond, of the Inheritance and Poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, between the Relations of a dead Husband and the Wife, who Aſſerted her ſelf with Child. But in the Caſe of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> I think there was no Divorſe; neither could there be any diſpute of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the buſineſs, when his Father, King <hi>James,</hi> was then alive; and conſequently no ſuch thing as Succeſſion or Miſſion in the Poſſeſſion of the Goods of him who was ſtill living.

By the by, I cannot omit wondring, ſince this Gentleman ſeems to be ſo mightily taken (and I may well enough add ſo mightily miſtaken) with Civil Law, he did not gratify the World with an Expoſition of the Edict of the Emperors <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian Cod.

            <p>In this buſineſs I have deſignedly waved giving you the Expoſition of the moſt Celebrated Civilians <hi>Cujacius, Molinaeus,</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> upon theſe paſſages, I have had occaſion to quote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was loth to have my Letter ſwell to a Volume. But if any curious Gentleman will take the pains to examine the Learned Works of the foremention'd Civilians, he will find their Expoſitions agreeable to what I have produced theſe Laws for.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now briefly obſerve what I judge material to object to his old Common Law, and then take my leave of him and you for the preſent. I ſhall ſave both the Expence of Time and Paper, if I only deſire you to peruſe that Chapter in <hi>Bracton,</hi> to which his Margin does refer you; you'l find it chiefly concerns what the Civil Law, I mentioned before, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for: And as for <hi>Fleta</hi> (who almoſt in every thing follows <hi>Bracton,</hi>) he ſays, <hi>That ſuppoſing the Husband and Wife being Summoned by the King to appear before the Sheriffs, upon Complaint of the next Heir, that they have Forg'd and Suborn'd a ſuppoſititious Child.</hi> To uſe his own Words. <hi>Si po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes videbantur eſſe Parentes, ad Prolem ſuſcitandam pro haerede judicabitur niſi querens decere poſſit Contrarium. That if the Parents be thought able to get Children (their Child) ſhall be adjudged Heir, except the Plaintiff can prove the contrary.</hi> Take Notice here what both <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> ſay, <hi>That this Writ is to be Iſſued out by the King, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore granting this were now true Law (which I deny) yet I cannot perceive how it would reach the King. For who is ſo mad to ſuppoſe the King would iſſue out a Writ to his Officer, for the Examining the Queen, his Wife, with whoſe Iſſue he himſelf is well ſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His friend <hi>Bracton</hi> would have told him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Old Law,</hi> That if the King Rule indeed contrary to the Laws of the Land; that all that Subjects ought to do in the matter is to have recourſe to ſupplication (to uſe his Words,) <hi>Cum Breve non currat contra ipſum.</hi>) That he would correct his Error, which (ſays he) if he refuſes and denies to do, 'tis altogether ſufficient puniſhment for him, That he expect God a Revenger. For (as he goes on) no Man may preſume to call his Actions in Queſtion, much leſs riſe up againſt his Act. <hi>Bracton. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>de acquirendo rerum Dominio, fol.</hi> 5.</p>

But if a Man ſeized of Lands in Fee (for Example) hath Iſſue a Daughter, who is Heir Apparent; She in the Life of her Father cannot have this Writ for divers Cauſes. Firſt, Becauſe She is not Heir, but Heir Apparent; for; as hath been ſaid, <hi>Nemo eſt Haeres Viventis;</hi> and this Writ is given to the Heir to whom the Land is deſcended. And both <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> ſay that this Writ lieth <hi>ad querelam veri Haeredis,</hi> which cannot be in the Life of his Anceſtor, and herewith agreeth <hi>Britton</hi> and the Regiſter. Secondly, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Husband, in the Caſe aforeſaid, being her own Act, cannot barr the Heir of his lawful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175411:3"/>Action once veſted in him. Thirdly, the Law doth not give the Heir Apparent any Writ; for 'tis not certain whether he ſhall be Heir <hi>Solus Deus facit Haeredes.</hi> Fourthly, the Inconvenience were too great, if Heirs Apparent in the Life of their Anceſtors, ſhould have ſuch a Writ to examine and try a Man's lawful Wife, in ſuch ſort as the Writ <hi>de Ventre Inſpiciendo</hi> doth appoint; Or if She ſhould be found to be with Child, or ſuſpect; then She muſt be removed to a Caſtle, and there ſafely kept until her Delivery; and ſo any Man's Wife might be taken from him againſt the Laws of God and Man.</q> So far my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke.

            <p>You may now ſee what obliged our Anſwerer to run to his Civil and Old Common Law, the firſt being little practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> and neither that nor Old Common Law underſtood, but by the moſt eminent Profeſſors. But for the modern Expoſition of Laws, he ſuppoſed we were a little better verſed in. I hope ſome of our able Lawyers will take care to vindicate the Honour of their Profeſſion, and not ſuffer it to be thus abuſed by crafty People, to inſinuate Falſhood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and poyſon the minds of the Ignorant and Unwary.

Before I take my Farewel, I cannot omit ſaying ſomewhat to the grand popular Objection generally urged, <hi>That it is not expected that the Birth of the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>be proved Spurious, ſince a Negative will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Proof.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the aſſerting his Highneſs, the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> not to be K. <hi>J</hi>'s Son is an Affirmative. For ſuppoſe I aſſert <hi>Titius</hi> not to be the Son of <hi>Cajus,</hi> I affirm him to be the Son of Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe: So till the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> be proved to be the Son of Some-body elſe than of K. <hi>J</hi>—s, I ſhould do a very great Injury to Equity and Common Juſtice (ſince his Father has own'd him) ſhould I pronounce him a Baſtard. Beſide, the Matter never came to Litigation or Diſpute; and to hang People before we judge 'em, has ever, I think, been deem'd and look'd upon as too ſevere and unjuſt. We ought, in an Affair of ſuch Moment, to be very wary and cautious how we proceed; ſince the Example, I fear, may be of direful and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſequence.
